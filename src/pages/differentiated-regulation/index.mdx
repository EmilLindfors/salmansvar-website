Tasmania produces around 55.000 Tn p.a. of Atlantic Salmon, which is comparatively small compared to the Norwegian production of 1200.000 Tn p.a. While the industry may be small, the region nonetheless has significant dynamic couplings between the industry, research and educational institutions as well as the regulatory authorities which have created a well functioning innovation system. 
The Tasmanian regulatory regime has contributed to more innovation and a smaller environmental footprint for the Tasmanian salmon farming industry. In this article we discuss the possiblity for the norwegian industry to learn from the tasmanian regulatory regime.
